Currently I am working on this task. It will be the stock screener Power BI report (direct query mode) that will also include paginated report in it. 
I use PosstgreSQL database, web scraping and API integration with polygon.io. 
For now it is on it's final stages, soon I will complete paginated report in Power BI report Builder and embed it in Power BI report on the second sheet.
